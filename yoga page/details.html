Incredible Yogasanas For High Blood pressure
Uttanasana (Forward Bent Pose)
While standing, bring the feet hip-distance apart. Without bending your knees, slowly bend your 
body above the torso downwards. See that your knees are straight. You can allow your hands and 
hang down and rest your palms on the ground or just hold your feet to the ankles. Hold this 
position for 8-10 breaths, then slowly get back to the standing position.
Benefits:
Also known as Pada Hasthasana, this inverted anti-gravity posture is an extremely therapeutic 
pose that enhances your immunity, attenuates stress and relaxes the mind. It helps the blood 
gush to the head and enhance blood circulation. It also regulates the flow of blood, calms down 
the body and stabilizes the heart rate.
Viparita Karani (Legs Up The Wall Pose)
Initially, sit about 3 inches from an empty wall. Lie onto the back and swing your legs upwards in 
such a way that the back of the thigh rests against the wall. Rest your entire back, i.e. the spinal 
column on the floor below and relax the arms on either side of the body or the tummy. Hold the 
position for 10 minutes or as long as you can and then slowly pull your leg back to the starting 
position.
Benefits:
This posture is one of the relaxing poses that allows you to lie flat on the ground with your legs 
up without much twisting. Yet, the Viparita Karini is one such beneficial yogasana that allows 
lymphatic drainage, evens out blood circulation, and releases pressure from the back and hip. It 
not only helps in relieving stress but also detoxifies the system. By keeping the blood flow in 
check, it helps to control and bring down high blood pressure.
Sethubandhasana (Bridge Pose)
Start the posture by lying flat on your back. Now bend your knees and elbows. Place your feet 
flat on the floor close to the hips and your hands firmly on either side of the head. While 
supporting both your hands and legs on the ground, slowly try to lift your body up into the air. 
Hold this arching posture for 20-30 secs and slowly bring your body up into a standing pose.
Benefits:
This is an extremely beneficial posture for not only relieving arthritic pain but also strengthening 
the leg, thigh and back muscles. By lifting the heart at a raised level than that of the head, it 
facilitates blood circulation to even the most difficult and out of reach places. It also releases 
blocked channels and effectively brings down blood pressure.
Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-facing dog pose)
Come on all fours with your knees hips-width apart and your hands shoulder-width apart. Now, 
slowly lift your hips off the floor and straighten your elbows and knees. Ensure that your body 
forms an inverted ‘V’. Now, press your hands into the ground and stretch your neck such that 
your ears should touch your inner arms, and you should turn your gaze towards your navel. Hold 
this position for five-eight breathes and then return to the original position.
Benefits:
The downward facing dog-pose is one of the most effective yogasanas for managing high blood 
pressure. It not only stretches the spine and the shoulders but also releases trapped stress, 
brings down high blood pressure and promotes overall blood circulation. Practicing it regularly 
enhances cardiac functioning too.
Shavasana (Corpse Pose):
Lie down on your back and close your eyes. Relax your body and mind. and think happy peaceful 
thoughts. Take your time while you do this. Breathe normally and do not hold your breath. After 
some time, stand up.
Benefit:
This yogasana not only cools the body, calms the mind and marks the end of the yoga session 
but also helps curb the spread of cardiac anomalies and respiratory issues. The asana not only 
brings relaxation to the mind and body but also reduces blood pressure and brings down the 
heart rate. This ultimate resting pose helps the brain process the workout and allows the body to 
employ the benefits.</p>
